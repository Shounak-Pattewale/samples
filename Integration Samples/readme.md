Integration Samples
-------------------

The example sub folders in the Integration Samples section are in relation to how they should be configured on your local machine. Copy the files into one of the below directories based on your Zynk version:

- C:\ProgramData\Internetware\Zynk\1.0\
- C:\ProgramData\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0\

The above directories will already contain 'Data' and 'My Workflows' folders. Overwrite or copy the files into these directories. For example, if I was going to download the Excel to XML to my new instance of Zynk on my local machine, I would carry out the following steps:

- Download the samples.zip 
- Extract and copy the 'Data' and 'My Workflows' folders into my working Zynk directory.
- Open Zynk and test the workflow and files attached.

Caution: Please be careful when overwriting directories if you have existing integrations set up on your machine as files could get lost.
